# Eight_Queens_App
An application which returns random solutions to the Eight Queens puzzle.
I created this application to showcase my skills using Ruby on Rails with React, Bootstrap and Sass.

To run this app clone the repo and then:
1) yarn install && bundle install
2) npm run dev
3) open http://localhost:3000

You will see an error for livereload in Google Chrome Developer's console.
This is fine. If you'd like to use livereload to automatically reload
the browser on any file change:

4) open a second terminal, navigate to project folder
5) bundle exec guard

Now you can make changes and browser automatically reloads. If you
restart the servers, Step 2 has to happen before Step 5 for guard
to work properly
